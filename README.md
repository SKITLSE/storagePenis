## ‚å®Ô∏è Setup

> Pleas note that Pingvin Share is in early stage and could include some bugs

### Recommended installation

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`

### Integrations

#### ClamAV

With ClamAV the shares get scanned for malicious files and get removed if any found.

1. Add the ClamAV container to the Docker Compose stack (see `docker-compose.yml`) and start the container.
2. Docker will wait for ClamAV to start before starting Pingvin Share. This may take a minute or two.
3. The Pingvin Share logs should now log "ClamAV is active"

Please note that ClamAV needs a lot of [ressources](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Installing/Docker.html#memory-ram-requirements).
